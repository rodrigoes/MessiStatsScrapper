Messi Stats Scrapper is a project that collects statistics of the football player Lionel Messi using a Python scrapper with the BeautifulSoup library, and processes them into JSON files. In addition, a FastAPI API is created to provide access to the collected information.

Match and goal data were taken from the site: http://messi.starplayerstats.com/en/, aggregated data were made in the code itself.
