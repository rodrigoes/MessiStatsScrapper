Messi Stats Scrapper is a project that collects statistics of the football player Lionel Messi using a Python scrapper with the BeautifulSoup library, and processes them into JSON files. In addition, a FastAPI API is created to provide access to the collected information.

Match and goal data were taken from the site: http://messi.starplayerstats.com/en/, aggregated data were made in the code itself.

## üìã Requirements

To run the Messi Stats Scrapper, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## üíæ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rodrigoes/MessiDashboard.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies: For this step you need Git installed, but you can just download the zip file instead by clicking the button at the top of this page ‚òùÔ∏è

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

To collect the statistics, run the Scrapper.py script with the following command:

```
python Scrapper.py
```

This script will download the data from the website and process it into JSON files that will be stored in the data directory.

To start the FastAPI API, run the Main.py script with the following command:

```
